class="c17 c29"><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c21">Theme 01: Basic Web</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&#9675; 01.04.01 Responsive website</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the Basic Web theme we learned about the primary tools within the MMD profession. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We learned about user interface design, digital communication, user testing and responsive web design. We also learned that as multimedia designers we design for a multitude of devices formats, from mobile phones to computers. We can use tools like Adobe XD to help us design for these sizes and basic design principles to help us make it look good, like the Gestalt principle and contrasts, balance.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We also learned about the design processes and documentations used in digital media productions like basic colour theory, colour schemes, mood board, style tiles, icon design, typography, sketching,wireframing and prototyping a website. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">What I learned most during this theme is the value of using CSS grids, both for responsive web design and as an overall design tool.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c14 c21"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c21">Projects in this theme: 01.04.01. Responsive Website:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c14 c21"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c21">About this project:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In this task we were introduced to responsive design. I was tasked to make a website that was responsive and fit the Jazz theme Blue Note. What was very challenging for me was the design around Blue Note records did not interest me at all. However, I pushed forward and designed my website.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c21">What kept me motivated?:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I decided to pursue an idea that this website would include a &ldquo;store&rdquo;, as I do have a degree in Retail Management, I always wanted to open up an online store for myself. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I set up the website to mimic a culture house, it would have a venue that sells tickets to concerts an online store that sells jazz albums, t-shirts and Instruments as well host a newsletter and a blog, all about Jazz.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I effectively turned a style that I didn&rsquo;t like into a new brand identity.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23 c21">Mood Board and Style Tile:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In this project we designed a mood board and a styletile to help us with the design, in the styletile you decide which font your using, as well as accentrics about your websites, here you include the colour codes and icons as well. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the moodboard you take together a multitude of pictures or art pieces into one canvas, this gives you a feeling for the colour theme and the design principles that is going to be used in the production.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c21">Wireframing beforehand:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I used Adobe XD to make a high fidelity wireframe of my design before starting to code the website. This really helped me continue the creative flow before going into coding. Adobe XD has nice tools meant to help you with the design aspects, like guides and helps your elements keep with the Gestalt principles.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23 c21">Solution for responsiveness:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In order to make this site responsive I used CSS grids. I started to make the entire website in a grid layout setup. I had an article look\layout on my About and Newsletter pages and then I had an online store look/layout set up for the &ldquo;store&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The store has three columns and can host as many rows as you want. I used a @media query to dismantle the grids when the website would be shrunk, each child element would then re-arrange themselves into a flexbox grid. The flexbox has a max of two columns and a minimum of 1, effectively making the store change in response to its environment.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The grids used in all other areas on the website have a fixed width compared to the viewport width and an automatic height (set in CSS), making it shrink or get bigger with its environment.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c21">Responsive Navbar:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When designing a responsive webpage it&rsquo;s very good to make the navigation also responsive. For this I made the navbar change into a dropdown menu (burger menu) when the site reached a minimum of 800px width or less. This ensures that the design of the webpage doesn&rsquo;t get messy, and the user doesn&rsquo;t lose their way.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">What I learned from this was that having a burger menu at the top-left corner is not a very user friendly solution for mobile users, as the distance from the thumb to the menu is significant. Better have the navbar change to the bottom-right corner.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#9679; Theme 02: Basic Animation</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25">In the Basic Animation theme, we learned about design processes and documentation used in our profession, like character design model sheets, </span><span class="c6">pose sheets,</span><span class="c25">&nbsp;style tiles, </span><span class="c6">sketching methods narrative curve, storyboard, ideation methods. </span><span class="c25">We learned to incorporate CSS animations, sprite sheets, javascript to trigger the CSS animations and how to integrate and edit sounds.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">As well as learning all these design processes we also learned about project management and were introduced to the SCRUM method, and iterative and agile project development method. We also learned about user testing of digital productions and were introduced to peer review and think aloud testing methods.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">We applied these basic theories and tools to manage simple multimedia production throughout the theme.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><ul class="c31 lst-kix_h7r7zvup4eki-0 start"><li class="c1 c22"><span class="c0">02.02.01. Week Submission part one part two and part three</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">In this project I was tasked with making a digital character, a storyboard, a style tile, a sprite sheet with a background and a story.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">I really like making stories, for this one I made a very bleek one with two possible endings, since it&rsquo;s inherently a tragedy, either one or both the characters die, depending on the choice you make (and the choice is not obvious).</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Solution:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The storyboard:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Was hand drawn by me, I am not that great of an artist to be honest, I have a better time drawing in the computer, as you can see below. The storyboard has a clear view of the surroundings and the characters emotions, including &ldquo;camera&rdquo; angles and transition through time.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Narrative Curve:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c25">I decided to make the story end in a very excited but then bleek manor, therefore there is no drop in the end of the curve like a traditional Narrator Curve. This one ends at the highest point.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Character design:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">I decided to use flat design, I designed the character from scratch, to do so I used a blank character sketch and followed the shapes in illustrator. The character has minimal to no lines, shadows make the details. The shapes are organizing and asymmetrical.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">To accomplish this design I used sketch outlines of models. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23 c25">Worksheet:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">The worksheet was very interesting to fill out, I really got to imagine my characters life. Filling out the characters main goals in life and what they need to do to fulfill them, brings them to life. The fact that there&rsquo;s so many aspects from social, physical and environmental will give you such a clear image of the character.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23 c25">Sprite sheet:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Working on the sprite sheet was a little bit of a challenge for me because of the many detailed shapes I made my character in. To tackle this problem I decided to try Adobe Character Animator, after some hours of figuring out how it works, I tried hooking up my character with the animator. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Needless to say, it looked horrible, I started freaking out a little bit since it was very close to the hand in date. For you see I spent so much time on my character development. In a bit of a rush I made 8 variations of my character walking, tediously changing the limbs one by one in illustrator, hoping it would look better. It did look a lot better as you can see here:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">I got a comment about the pattern on the ground being to complex that it was hard to follow, I agree with that, so I reiterated it for the portfolio.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c16">02.04.06 Link to Final Interactive Production</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c14 c16"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c16">About this project:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">For this project we were tasked to create an online interactive movie poster with Cinemateket as the faux client. We had a few movies we could choose from, we chose the Shining. The main goal was to get our target audiences to come to Cinemateket to see the movie after having seen the trailer.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c16">A team effort:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">This project is a team project, where me and my teammates were chosen to work together based on the different type of person we are, for this method we put ourselves into a stereotypical roleplay. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">We had the &ldquo;prophead&rdquo; (Indre) who oversaw most of the coding and markup for this project. Then we have the &ldquo;ponytail&rdquo; (Sigrun) who oversaw most of the design and Illustrations and then there was me the suit. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">This matchmaking is what the teachers called, quick and dirty method of finding someone that&rsquo;s willing to take on a specific role.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23 c16">Target audience:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">As a team we used a very crude and stereotypical method to find a fictional target audience. We chose the basic hipster that likes coffee houses and has a run down bike living in Copenhagen.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23 c16">My role:</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">I chose to be the suit, the one that would manage the project and see to that it would be finished. I managed the project respectfully well. I had a few other roles during this project as well, I directed the audio through the interactive poster and helped with a little coding and some of the illustrations.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">I integrated the SCRUM method in our team to help us keep track of our unfinished tasks.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c16">Testing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">We tested the interactive poster on a few people including one of the teachers with the peer review and think aloud methods, after which we concluded that the whole poster was a little dragged out (it was too long). I understood the role of the Multimedia Designer can be very varied, but that focus is really necessary in order to finish a project.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">We took the testing as a valid remark and fixed the scenes to make them shorter.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c16">Solution to our interactive poster:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c14 c16"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c16">Adobe illustrator:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Sigrun was our main graphic designer for this project and designed all the graphics in Adobe illustrator. Two scenes in the interactive poster is a sprite sheet animation.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c16">HTML and CSS:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Indre was our main coder she made the HTML markup is extremely simple for this movie poster, we used CSS for positioning and animations of the illustrations. We also embedded the audio files here.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c16">Javascript:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Our interactive project was sequenced and stitched using javascript timeout and CSS class changing codes. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c16">Audio:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">I managed the audio files, I got my hands on the movie in wav. Format with a 5.1 audio channel. I used Adobe Audition to isolate the sound so I was able to separate the music from the speech and I was also able to make some pitch changes. So we integrated original soundtrack audio files in mp3 format into the production.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c16">Here is our short process documentation presentation:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c24"><a class="c19" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ipey1aJMMW_tyrRMXq-I5eyThjaQ6FDufwBAc7iX64Q/edit%23slide%3Did.g57d5baccc1_1_0&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1560627374147000">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ipey1aJMMW_tyrRMXq-I5eyThjaQ6FDufwBAc7iX64Q/edit#slide=id.g57d5baccc1_1_0</a></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">Theme 03: Basic Content</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c18">In the Basic Content theme we learned about layout compositions and visual communication. We learned about videography, transitions and editing. We applied a lot of things that we learned from the previous two modules as well f.ex 5 second test and an expert test.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12 c18"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c18">We reiterated the way we worked in our last team, this time we had a few more tools to work even better with each other than in the last theme. We created a storyboard for a video this time around, a wireframe and xd prototype as well as a website hosting our main project for the theme, a video guide about how to bike in Copenhagen for non-Danes.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">A Team Canvas:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c18">The teamcanvas is a lovely way to bring together a group of people and form a team, the reason for this is a common goal setting and a declaration of transparency.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12 c18"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c18">As a team we set our goals for the project but we also got to know one another better, our weaknesses and how we can all pitch in to help each other if needed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c18">Tiny bit more here</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12 c18"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c23">The </span><span class="c11">Storyboard:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c18">Our team was tasked to create a storyboard for the main film project of the theme. We were very eager to start filming so we made the storyboard very quickly. The storyboard is used to plan out every scene in your production. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12 c18"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c18">Here you have to meticulously plan the environment, the position of the actor, the movement of the actor and the movement of the camera.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c18">We made a minor mistake doing our storyboard. It&rsquo;s good enough to pass, but I personally would have preferred that we would have given the on-camera transitions more thought, i.e. the starting and closing scenes.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12 c18"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c18">To fix minor problem I tried to find the best transitions in post video editing.

The ones you see on the go, i.e. on the train for.ex. Our inspiration came from various news agencies that market on facebook and social media. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12 c18"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">The Website</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c18">The website was very much like the XD prototype, it follows a design trends you see a lot from news agencies, we placed our video on top for the viewer to see right away, to get the user to click on the video, instead of leaving our site out of frustration (if the user is not a big reader).</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12 c18"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c18">Here we learned how to embed a video into </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12 c18"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">Here is the link to the website that hosts the video.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c24 c18"><a class="c19" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://indre101.github.io/Bicycle_101/html/index.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1560627374150000">https://indre101.github.io/Bicycle_101/html/index.html</a></span><span class="c18">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14">&#9679; Theme 04: Basic UX</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">&#9675; 04.01.01 Design Sprint</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c20">04.02.01 Web Prototype:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Links:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Login-page/</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c24 c27"><a class="c19" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ingimar-eyfjord.github.io/04.02.01_web_prototype/Index.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1560627374152000">https://ingimar-eyfjord.github.io/04.02.01_web_prototype/Index.html</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Login-page/</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c24 c27"><a class="c19" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://iesdesigner.eu/School%2520Folder/04.02.01_web_prototype/Index.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1560627374152000">http://iesdesigner.eu/School%20Folder/04.02.01_web_prototype/Index.html</a></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c20">Long term goal:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The long term goal is for students to have access to Fronter through their phone. To give the students a portable platform for their busy lives. This will in return increase the engagement from the student&rsquo;s and hasten their workflow.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Make a social media platform on fronter that will increase engagement between students and administrators.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The problem:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Currently the Fronter we use today is not mobile friendly, therefore a lot of students opt to wait until they reach their PC&rsquo;s in order to log on. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">A lot of the problems caused by Fronter today is that nothing is responsive and the schedule is the least scalable thing there. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to use it through the phone.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c20">My solution:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Make the mobile version of Fronter easily navigable through design, designing an interface that looks and feels like an app is my approach to achieving this. Make a social media platform based on twitter with added functions like Direct Messaging system.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Design:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">I started out by writing up and coding based on the design we used for the XD prototype. I designed using the same structure but ultimately I varied with design.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">For the primary colours I decided to take the colours of the KEA page and use that for the header, navbar and the background the colour of the KEA logo is also used as an accent colour.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">For the secondary colours I used the KEA style guide, I choose to use the light pastel colours. For the logos I got then from a website that has a lot of different logos, I chose a set of linear design logos.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15">Functionalities &amp; reasoning:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Login:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">There&rsquo;s a tutorial on YouTube that teaches how to do a login function, I might go ahead and implement that login function to my web prototype with a pre set up password and username.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c20">Modules:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;I&rsquo;m am essentially designing a drop down menu that directs the user between the semesters to their projects. The idea is simple enough but can be confusing if you don&rsquo;t really know the structure before hand, but then again, no one knew the structure to begin with anyway. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The idea is that here you will also be able to see your feedback from the teachers with an icon on the side of each project, the icon would make the element behave in the same way as it does when clicked. It will drop down (expand) with the current feedback.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The end path will lead the user to the current project.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Current project:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">This is basically a shortcut. There is a way to this page from the homepage, and in the navigation bar in the bottom. Here students can easily access the current project instead of navigation through the modules.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c20">Newsfeed:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The newsfeed is meant to be a sort of social media platform with all the relative information that is circulating around KEA and the students, my inspiration was twitter. Here the administration and can post news articles and information as well as a &ldquo;tweet&rdquo; or a picture they want to share.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Inside the platform there&rsquo;s an opening box with more settings and functionalities (press on the picture or HOME button). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">There you have information about yourself and your followers. The idea here is that you can search for other people, choose what hashtags to follow or unfollow. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Schedule:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The idea behind the schedule is derived from an app that I use for work, it&rsquo;s fairly simple to use and you can see the whole week in one viewport.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15">The code: Login:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The login form has an input field, a type, name and a value fields.

Despite the small bugs it makes sense, the colors and the picture might be to much, it was all clear but perhaps the icons for the current task and the module. Liked the little details.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Overall I would very much like to use it in real life - main page is distracting at first impression (in the navbar).

The problem that students face is the messy interface of the current fronter. My prototype fixes those things and makes it more intuitive and quicker to access the information needed.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The only problem might be the structure of the modules.
